This is Week-0 challange for Kifiya AI Mastery Training Cohort 3. The purpose of the project is to conduct EDA for Moonlight Solar company using the dataset shared Data.zip and provide  data driven recommendations.


## Project Overview
This project contains a comprehensive data analysis and visualization workflow using Python. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook, leveraging popular Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data manipulation and visualization.

In this project, you will find the following components:
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Contain the data analysis and visualization steps, including cleaning, exploration, and in-depth insights.
- **Python Libraries**: We use libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, and `numpy` for efficient analysis and visualization.
- **Data**: The dataset is not included in this repository

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.
-
## Requirements

To run the project and Jupyter Notebooks locally, you will need Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- jupyter

You can install all required dependencies by running the following command:
